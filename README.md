Petzro
======

Petzro is a project management solution. This project is build by Usama Noman. This project management system is build using the open source technologies including NodeJS, MongoDB, and ExpressJS. I am looking to maintain the version control of this product. This is a public open source product anyone can make the updates and report the bugs in the project.


To Run this project on your local machine you need to install "NodeJS" from the official website of NodeJS.

Secondly after installing you will need to naviagte to the folder using the cmd commands.

After reaching the folder you will need to type "npm install".
This will install all the packages you need to run this project.

Type Node app.js from your command line keeping in mind that you have server running.
